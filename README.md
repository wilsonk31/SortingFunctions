Python Sorting Functions

Background: Project for my Python class to write and analyze diffrent sorting techniques such as bubble sort, selection and insertion. Below is my report...

Sorting Technique 



Analyzing the three-different sorting technique, bubble, selection, and insertion. I have concluded that selection sorting is a better technique compared to the other two. In the 100-random number list, all the 3 techniques all performed the same, about 0.13 seconds. The 1,000-random list selection sorting performed better compared to the other two with 0.38 seconds, and the worst was bubble sorting with 0.47 seconds. Selection also performed better with a 10,000-random number list, 6.3 seconds, insertion sorting took 8.8 seconds, and bubble sort took the longest, about 23.4 seconds to complete. 
The original test conditions included a 100,000-random number list, and when I ran it through the bubble sort, I had to terminate the program because it was taking too long to sort through the list. Bubble sort took the longest because it had to move though the list several times and making several exchanges for it to complete the sorting. Selection was better because it only makes one exchange per passing through the list. In conclusion, the selection sorting method was the better technique compared to the other two.
